# Analysis on New York Times comments & articles


The following report outlines the data scientific approaches employed to solve pressing business and user experience concerns for the New York Times, a vast journalism and publishing company. The goal of the project was two-tiered: helping the NYT understand the demographic, engagement, and use trends to improve customer outreach and marketing activities; and designing an algorithm to help NYT automate, at least partly, the process with which they select NYT Picks: comments on articles that the NYT finds insightful and resourceful for the “general readership”. The project successfully outlined geographic trends in application usage through comments data as a key performance indicator and metric for assessment. We also identified key topics, authors, and themes that prompt most engagement: news, op-ed, and editorial content. These insights were driven by robust Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and were corroborated by testing data collected over a year and a half. Finally, an NLP-enabled, sentiment informed classification algorithm was defined to predict which comments would be more likely to be selected as NYT Picks. The classification algorithm has substantial predictive ability, and can be successfully implemented to reduce costs, boost revenues, and improve user experience for customers using the NYT app.
